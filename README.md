# Furballs
dumb little compression method that I use when I can't upload a file because even a zip has 80MB+
so yeah I won't explain how to use it further, all you need to know is:
> furball -rdh xyz xyz.furball compresses xyz into a xyz.furball
> furball -edh xyz.furball xyz decompresses xyz.furball into xyz
